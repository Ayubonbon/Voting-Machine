# Voting Machine 
A blockchain based voting machine is my mini project during my course of learning the technology.
This project implements a decentralized voting machine using blockchain technology, specifically written in Solidity and developed using the Remix IDE.

# Features 
 - Security: Built on blockchain, the system is resistant to tampering and unauthorized access.
 
 - Immutable Record: Once a vote is cast, it cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity of the voting process.
 
 - Unique storage of data: It stores all the cated votes in the form of unique hashes which are linked to one another causing to form a chain of immutable record that cannot be tampered.

# Technologies Used

 - Solidity: The smart contracts defining the voting logic.
    
 - Remix IDE: Integrated development environment for writing, testing, and deploying Solidity contracts. 

# Setup Instructions

To set up and deploy the voting machine:

    - Clone this repository.
    - Open the Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your web browser.
    - Create a new file and copy-paste the Solidity code from voting.sol into the file.
    - Compile the Solidity code using the Remix compiler.
